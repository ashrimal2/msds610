# Linear Regression With Credit Rating Prediction Project

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

It performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). 

The simplest form of a simple linear regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is represented by:

## Project

Let’s consider a problem statement, we want to predict Credit Rating of a customer based on certain information of the customer.

Dataset Information:
The dataset contains information about 400 credit card holders, their credit balances, demographic features, etc.


Contents:
There are 11 variables.

Income: Income of the customer.
Limit: Credit limit provided to the customer.
Rating: The customer's credit rating.
Cards: The number of credit cards the customer has.
Age: Age of the customer.
Education: Educational level of the customer.¶
Gender: Sex of the customer.
Student: If the customer is a student or not.
Married: If the customer is married.
Ethnicity: Ethnicity of the customer.
Balance: Credit balance of the customer.

To solve this problem we use the above data and try to predict the Credit Rating of the customer.
