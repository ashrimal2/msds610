- The term "regression"  generally refers to predicting a real number. However, it can also be used for classification (predicting a category or class.)
- A linear combination is an expression where one or more variables are scaled by a constant factor and added together. 
- In the case of linear regression with a single explanatory variable, the linear combination used in linear regression can be expressed as:
    response = intercept + constant âˆ—explanatory 
- In its most basic form fits a straight line to the response variable. The model is designed to fit a line that minimizes the squared differences (also called errors or residuals.).

1. Linear Regression is very versitile and is widly applicational
    - Used in many different industries: Tech, Marketing, Medical
2. Linear Regression is easily understandable and explain
    - Provides concrete data that can be interpreted
    - Theory/Math behind the implementation is not difficult
3. Linear Regression is very simple to implement but still very powerful
    - Many different libraries and functions used to create ordinary least squares models
