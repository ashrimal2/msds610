## What is Linear Regression?

<center><img src='images/slr.png'></center>

- The term "regression"  generally refers to predicting a real number. However, it can also be used for classification (predicting a category or class.)
- A linear combination is an expression where one or more variables are scaled by a constant factor and added together. 
- In the case of linear regression with a single explanatory variable, the linear combination used in linear regression can be expressed as:
    response = intercept + constant âˆ—explanatory 
- In its most basic form fits a straight line to the response variable. The model is designed to fit a line that minimizes the squared differences (also called errors or residuals.). 

## Why should we use Linear Regression?

1. Linear Regression is very versitile and is widly applicational
    - Used in many different industries: Tech, Marketing, Medical
2. Linear Regression is easily understandable and explain
    - Provides concrete data that can be interpreted
    - Theory/Math behind the implementation is not difficult
3. Linear Regression is very simple to implement but still very powerful
    - Many different libraries and functions used to create ordinary least squares models

## Applications of Linear Regression:
1. Predicting amount of money allocated for gas
    - Predictors: MPG, miles travelling, etc
2. Predicting the average grades of students in a class
    - Predictors: hours spent studying per week, current GPA, age, etc.
3. Insert Adit/Prithvi Application
4. Least Squares estimates (the core principle behind Linear Regression) has applications in other domains
    - GPS positioning uses Weighted Linear Squares estimation to compute the user location. When applications like Google Maps/Uber require location, this procedure is invoked in the background.


## Big Picture Of Linear Regression
- Linear Regression is a very common/popuar regression method
    - used for predicting values
- Linear Regression is versatile and widely applicational
    - can be used in various different types of industries
- Linear Regression is less of a black box and is easily communicated and implemented
